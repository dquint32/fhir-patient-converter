# FHIR Patient Data Converter (FHIR CONV2)

## Project Overview
This web-based tool is designed to bridge the gap between manual patient intake and digital health standards. It allows healthcare staff to input patient demographics and contact information in either **English or Spanish** and instantly convert that data into a valid **HL7 FHIR R4 Patient Resource**.

The application is built to be compatible with major EHR systems like Epic, Cerner, and Allscripts by following the **US Core Patient Profile**.

## 🛠 Features
* **Bilingual Interface**: Full support for English and Spanish speakers.
* **FHIR R4 Mapping**: Converts standard form fields into JSON objects compliant with `v4.0.1`.
* **Real-time Validation**: Validates phone numbers, emails, and required fields before generation.
* **Syntax Highlighting**: Provides a clean, readable view of the generated JSON output.
* **Export Options**: Users can copy the JSON to the clipboard or download it as a `.json` file for integration testing.

## 🏗 Technical Standards Used
* **Standard**: HL7 FHIR R4 (v4.0.1).
* **Profile**: US Core Patient (`StructureDefinition/us-core-patient`).
* **Identifiers**: Automated generation of synthetic Patient IDs and MRNs for testing purposes.

## 📂 File Structure
* `index.html`: The semantic HTML5 structure of the intake form and output display.
* `fhir-converter.css`: A "Medical Professional" aesthetic with responsive design and accessibility considerations.
* `fhir-converter.js`: The core logic for state management, bilingual translation, and FHIR mapping.
